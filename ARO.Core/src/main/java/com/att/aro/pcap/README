this package is here for backward compatible with old native lib.
PCapAdapter.java is the bridge between java code and native code which was compile 
to only work with packet com.att.aro.pcap. To remove this package and moving this 
PCapAdapter.java to the proper place: com.att.aro.core.packetreader.impl; we will
need to recompile all the native code, which we don't have have time as of now.
